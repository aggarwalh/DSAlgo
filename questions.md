# Questions

### Array and Statistics

1. Finding if there exist a sum X of two elements from and array having positive and negative numbers.
1. Maximum sum subarray from array having positive and negative numbers both.
1. Finding missing number in array. (How XOR approach works)
1. Given a stream of input Integers, at any time get the median of those numbers.
1. Next greater element for a given element in an array. 
1. Find an element in first increasing and decreasing array.
1. Given a string and pattern with (*, ?) Check if it can match the string.
1. Given an array of strings. Find all pairs which form palindrome. O(N)



### Linked List

1. Given a linked with next pointer and random pointer. Clone the linked List.

### Stack

1. Reverse a stack using recursion.


### Tree

1. Lowest common ancestor in a tree.
   1. Binary tree
   1. N-ary tree.
1. Given and given n and k value, find n node and then print all nodes having distance of k from nth node in both the direction
1. Distance between two given nodes in a binary tree. I was asked to write the optimal approach for the this.

### Graph

1. DFS and it's variants
   1. Cycle finding
   1. Topological sort
   
### Trie

1. Given a string of arrays “cat,dog,god,act”. Print all the anagrams which comes first in list.
eg.  output is cat ,act,dog and god. Means all the similar anagrams should be printed together and the next print should be the one which comes earlier in the list.

hint : Trie approach was expected here.
1.

### Cache

1. LRU Cache.

### Design (HLD and LLD)

1. Design a debugger
1. Design a meeting scheduler
1. HLD of clock room
1. HLD for Automatic Parking System
1. Design Bookmyshow : HLD, LLD and different race conditions discussion and scalability discussions.
1. Design Bookmyshow : HLD, LLD and different race conditions discussion and scalability discussions.

### Misc

1. A group of people are seated in a circular table. After a while , each members takes a chit and writes his name along 
with the next person name (anticlock wise.)   . If such chits are given , re draw the the table. A optimal approach was 
expected. eg. A – B – C- D – E – A . chits will be written as A-B B-C C-D etc
1. Same questions as above . if each member takes a chit and writes his neighbors name . re draw the table.
